## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stemmed from the difficulty in referencing and comprehending familial relation graphs for the English monarchy. As a result, the project creator decided to create a graphical representation that not only displays the reigns of all the monarchs but also illustrates their ancestral claims to the throne. While similar graphs existed, they were often confusing, lacked clarity, or were deficient in information.

For instance, the image provided on the Wikipedia page from which the data was scraped can be seen ![here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/kel7q8fxt834vxbcc06ct75fw2k99tc.png). Although this graph allows users to click on any monarch's name and be linked to the associated Wikipedia page (please visit the original [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_monarchs) for this feature), it only displays the monarch's name and reign dates. Conversely, a traditional family tree is often cluttered with the complex relations of the English monarchy, making it difficult to discern who is related to whom. Therefore, this project simplified the representation down to the reigning monarchs only.

## Scheduled-Feature-Additions
The following features are scheduled to be added in the future:
* Adding monarchs up to the present day.
* Adding family name coloring.
* Adding significant historical events to the time line.
* improving code efficiency.

## Usage
This program was developed using Google Colab and should run with minimal to no modifications on Google Colab. Simply download the [code file](https://github.com/marinwitherspoon/English-monarchs/blob/main/Processing.ipynb) and open it in Google Colab. 

Alternatively, it should be able to run on Jupyter Notebook with a few modifications, such as changing the package from ColabTurtlePlus to simply Turtle.

For examples of potential improvements for this project, please refer to the [Scheduled-Feature-Additions](#Scheduled-Feature-Additions) section.

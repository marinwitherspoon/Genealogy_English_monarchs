## Motivation
I found it difficult to refrence and understand familial relations in the english monarchy. So I decided to make a graph that would not only show when all the monarchs ruled but also their ancestrial claim to the throne. While simular graphs existed I found them confusing and unclear or lacking information. For example ![here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/kel7q8fxt834vxbcc06ct75fw2k99tc.png) is the image provided on the very Wikipedia page I scraped my data from. While this graph allows users to click on any monarchs name and be linked to the associated wikipedia page it only shows the name of the monarch and when they ruled. Alternatively, a traditional family tree is often very cluttered with the complex relations of the Enlglish monarchy making it difficult to follow who is related to who. Therefor, I simplified it down removing all famly ties unless they were the monarch themselves. 
## Scheduled Feature Additions
* Adding monarchs up to the present day.
* Adding family name coloring.
* Adding significant historical events to the time line.
* improving efficiency.
## Usage
Using should be relatively simple. This program was built using google Colab and should run with little to no modifications. Simply download the ![code file](https://github.com/marinwitherspoon/English-monarchs/blob/main/Processing.ipynb) and open in Google Colab. 
Alternatively it should be able to run on Jupyter Notebook with a few modifications such as changing the package ColabTurtlePlus to simply Turtle.
## Built-With
BeautifulSoup, ColabTurtlePlus, cairosvg, Pandas, re, requests
